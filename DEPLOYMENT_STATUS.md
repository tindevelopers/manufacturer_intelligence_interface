# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Status & Monitoring Guide

## ✅ Changes Pushed Successfully!

**Latest commit**: `edca5c5` - Fix Vercel build command: Use yarn workspace web build

**Changes made**:
1. ✅ Fixed `yarn.lock` symlink to use relative path
2. ✅ Created proper `vercel.json` configuration  
3. ✅ Updated build command to: `yarn workspace web build`
4. ✅ Tested build locally - **Build successful!**

---

## 📊 Check Deployment Status

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Select your project: `manufacturer_intelligence_interface`
3. Click on **Deployments** tab
4. Look for the latest deployment (commit: `edca5c5`)

### Option 2: Using Vercel CLI

First, login to Vercel:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/.npm-global/bin
cd /home/ubuntu/manufacturer_intelligence_interface
vercel login
```

Then check deployments:
```bash
vercel ls
```

Monitor specific deployment:
```bash
vercel inspect <deployment-url>
```

### Option 3: GitHub Integration
Check your GitHub repository's commits - Vercel should show deployment status there:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Deployment successful
- ❌ Red X = Deployment failed
- 🟡 Yellow circle = Deployment in progress

---

## 🔍 Expected Build Process

The Vercel build should now:

1. **Install dependencies**: `yarn install` ✓
2. **Run build command**: `yarn workspace web build` ✓
3. **Build Next.js app**: Should see "Creating an optimized production build..." ✓
4. **Output directory**: `apps/web/.next` ✓

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Environment Variables

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you've added the environment variable to Vercel!

### Steps to Add Environment Variable:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → **Settings**
2. Click **Environment Variables**
3. Add:
   - **Name**: `ABACUS_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `2802fae65af84b98883a39078c3929dd`
   - **Environments**: ✅ Production, ✅ Preview, ✅ Development
4. **Save**

### Verify Environment Variable:
After adding the environment variable, you may need to **redeploy**:
- Go to **Deployments** tab
- Click the "..." menu on the latest deployment
- Select **Redeploy**

---

## 🎯 Expected Success Message

Once deployment completes successfully, you should see:

```
✓ Deployment complete
✓ Ready at: https://your-project-name.vercel.app
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails:

1. **Check build logs** in Vercel Dashboard for specific errors
2. **Verify environment variable** is set correctly
3. **Ensure latest commit is deployed** (commit: `edca5c5`)

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Environment variable not set - Add `ABACUS_API_KEY`

**Issue**: "Build failed" 
**Solution**: Check Vercel build logs for specific error message

**Issue**: "404 Not Found"
**Solution**: Check that `outputDirectory` is correct: `apps/web/.next`

## 📝 Deployment Timeline

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 18:52 | Initial fix committed |
| 18:56 | First deployment failed (yarn.lock issue) |
| 18:57 | Second deployment failed (build command issue) |
| 19:00 | **Final fix pushed** (using workspace build command) |
| 19:01+ | **Awaiting deployment results** |

## ✅ What to Check After Deployment Succeeds

1. **Visit your deployment URL**
2. **Verify dashboard loads** - Should show "Pipeline Dashboard"
3. **Check pipelines display**:
   - Manufacturer Discovery Pipeline V2
   - Universal Product Intelligence Pipeline
4. **Test navigation**:
   - Click "View Manufacturers" button
   - Click "View Products" button
5. **Check for errors** in browser console (F12)

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Deployment shows "Ready" status
- ✅ App loads at the Vercel URL
- ✅ Both pipelines display correctly
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Navigation works properly
