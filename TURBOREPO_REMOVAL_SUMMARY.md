5. **âœ… Documentation Cleaned**
   - Removed Turborepo-specific documentation files
   - Updated README.md with correct project structure
   - Removed outdated PDF files

6. **âœ… CI/CD Pipeline Updated**

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
yarn dev                        # Start development server
yarn build                      # Build for production
yarn start                      # Start production server
yarn lint                       # Run ESLint

# Deployment
yarn deploy                     # Full deployment (build, test, deploy, push)
yarn deploy:vercel             # Deploy only to Vercel
yarn deploy:github             # Push only to GitHub
yarn push                      # Push to GitHub

# CI/CD
yarn ci                        # Run CI pipeline locally
```

### What's Working

- âœ… **Build Process**: Application builds successfully
- âœ… **Linting**: ESLint runs without errors (minor warnings only)
- âœ… **TypeScript**: Type checking works correctly
- âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions ready for deployment
- âœ… **Vercel Integration**: Ready for automatic deployments
- âœ… **Development Server**: Ready to run with `yarn dev`

### Next Steps

1. **Test Development Server**: Run `yarn dev` to ensure everything works locally
2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**: Set up required secrets for CI/CD
3. **Deploy to Vercel**: Push to GitHub to trigger automatic deployment
4. **Update Vercel Settings**: Ensure Vercel project settings point to root directory

### Backup Location

A complete backup of the original Turborepo structure is available at:
`/Users/gene/Projects/manufacturer_intelligence_interface_backup_[timestamp]`

## ðŸŽ‰ Turborepo Successfully Removed!

The project is now a clean, standard Next.js application with a simplified structure and working CI/CD pipeline.
