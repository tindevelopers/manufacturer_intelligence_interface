---

## 🔍 How to Check Deployment Status

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Find your project: `manufacturer_intelligence_interface`
3. Click **Deployments** tab
4. Look for commit: `edca5c5`

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Green status = Deployment successful
- 🟡 Yellow/Building = Deployment in progress
- ❌ Red/Failed = Deployment failed (check logs)

### Method 2: GitHub Repository

Go to: https://github.com/tindevelopers/manufacturer_intelligence_interface/commits/master

Look for the latest commit - Vercel will show:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Deployed successfully
- ❌ Red X = Deployment failed
- 🟡 Yellow dot = Deployment in progress

### Method 3: Vercel CLI

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/.npm-global/bin
cd /home/ubuntu/manufacturer_intelligence_interface
vercel login
vercel ls
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Environment Variables

### ⚠️ **YOU MUST ADD THIS TO VERCEL** ⚠️

**Without this, the deployment will succeed but the app won't work!**

#### Steps:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Click **Add New**
4. Add:
   ```
   Name: ABACUS_API_KEY
   Value: 2802fae65af84b98883a39078c3929dd
   ```
5. Select **ALL** environments:
   - ✅ Production
   - ✅ Preview
   - ✅ Development
6. Click **Save**

#### After Adding:
- If deployment is complete: Go to Deployments → Click "..." → **Redeploy**
- If deployment is in progress: Wait for it to complete, it will use the new variable

## 🎉 Expected Results

### After Successful Deployment:

1. **Deployment URL**: You'll get a URL like:
   - `https://manufacturer-intelligence-interface.vercel.app`
   - Or `https://manufacturer-intelligence-interface-[hash].vercel.app`

2. **App Functionality**:
   - ✅ Dashboard page loads
   - ✅ Shows two pipeline cards:
     - Manufacturer Discovery Pipeline V2 (fd507c760)
     - Universal Product Intelligence Pipeline (1398624bb0)
   - ✅ "View Manufacturers" button works
   - ✅ "View Products" button works
   - ✅ No console errors

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:

1. **Check Vercel build logs** for specific errors
2. **Verify vercel.json** is correct:
   ```json
   {
     "buildCommand": "yarn workspace web build",
     "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next"
   }
   ```
3. **Check that yarn.lock symlink** points to `../../yarn.lock`

### If App Loads but Shows Errors:

1. **Missing API key**: Add `ABACUS_API_KEY` to Vercel environment variables
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for specific errors
3. **Verify API key is correct**: `2802fae65af84b98883a39078c3929dd`

### If "Failed to Load Dashboard" Error:

This means the environment variable is not set or is incorrect:
- Double-check: Vercel Settings → Environment Variables → `ABACUS_API_KEY`
- Make sure it's set for **all environments**
- Redeploy after adding the variable
