## ✅ Confirmed: This IS a Turborepo!

Your project structure:
```
manufacturer_intelligence_interface/
├── apps/
│   └── web/           ← Next.js app here
├── packages/
├── turbo.json         ← Turborepo configuration
├── package.json       ← Root package.json with workspaces
└── vercel.json        ← Vercel configuration
```

## 🔧 CRITICAL: Vercel Project Settings Configuration

The build is **completing successfully**, but Vercel can't find the output directory. You need to configure your Vercel project settings:

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Project Settings

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/tindeveloper/manufacturer-intelligence-interface-web/settings**
2. Click on **General** settings

### Step 2: Configure Root Directory

In the "Root Directory" section:

**Option A: Set Root Directory to `apps/web`** (RECOMMENDED)

This tells Vercel that your Next.js app is in the `apps/web` subdirectory.

1. Click **Edit** next to "Root Directory"
2. Enter: `apps/web`
3. Check "Include source files outside of the Root Directory in the Build Step"
4. Click **Save**

**Option B: Keep Root Directory as `./` (current setup)**

If you want to build from the monorepo root:
1. Keep Root Directory as `./` or `.` (root)
2. Make sure the vercel.json configuration is correct (already done)
3. Ensure Build Command is: `turbo run build --filter=web`
4. Ensure Output Directory is: `apps/web/.next`

---

### Step 3: Verify Build & Development Settings

Go to: **Settings** → **General** → **Build & Development Settings**

#### Framework Preset:
- **Select**: `Other` (not Next.js, since it's in a subdirectory)

#### Build Command (if Root Directory is `./`):
```bash
turbo run build --filter=web
```

#### Output Directory (if Root Directory is `./`):
```
apps/web/.next
```

#### Install Command:
```bash
yarn install
```

#### Development Command:
```bash
turbo run dev --filter=web
```

---

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Add the API key to environment variables!

1. Go to: **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Click **Add New**
3. Add:
   ```
   Name:  ABACUS_API_KEY
   Value: 2802fae65af84b98883a39078c3929dd
   ```
4. Select **ALL** environments:
   - ✅ Production
   - ✅ Preview
   - ✅ Development
5. Click **Save**

---

## 🎯 Recommended Configuration

For a Turborepo monorepo on Vercel, **Option A** (Root Directory = `apps/web`) is the simplest:

### Vercel Project Settings:
- **Root Directory**: `apps/web`
- **Include source files outside root**: ✅ Checked
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Build Command**: Leave empty (auto-detect)
- **Output Directory**: Leave empty (auto-detect as `.next`)
- **Install Command**: Leave empty (auto-detect)

### Environment Variables:
- `ABACUS_API_KEY` = `2802fae65af84b98883a39078c3929dd` (all environments)

With this configuration:
- Vercel will auto-detect Next.js in `apps/web`
- It will automatically find `.next` output directory
- The build will complete successfully
- The deployment will work correctly

## 📊 What the Build Logs Show

Your latest build logs (commit: `edca5c5`) show:

✅ **Build Successful**:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages (7/7)
Done in 21.36s
```

❌ **Error**:
```
Error: No Output Directory named ".next" found after the Build completed.
```

**Cause**: Vercel is looking for `.next` at the wrong location.

**Solution**: Configure Root Directory to `apps/web` OR ensure Output Directory is correctly set to `apps/web/.next`.

---

## 🔍 Current Configuration

### ✅ Files Already Configured:

**vercel.json** (at root):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "turbo run build --filter=web",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next"
}
```

**turbo.json** (at root):
```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"],
      "env": ["ABACUS_API_KEY", "ABACUSAI_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

**apps/web/next.config.js**:
```javascript
{
  experimental: {
    outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname, '../'),
  }
}
```

These configurations are correct for a Turborepo monorepo.

## 🚀 After Configuration

Once you've updated the Vercel project settings:

### Step 1: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click on the latest deployment (commit: `955c1dd`)
3. Click the "..." menu
4. Select **Redeploy**

### Step 2: Monitor the Build

Watch the build logs - you should see:
1. ✅ Dependencies installed
2. ✅ `turbo run build --filter=web` executes
3. ✅ Next.js builds successfully
4. ✅ Output directory `.next` found
5. ✅ Deployment completes

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Visit your deployment URL and verify:
- ✅ Dashboard loads
- ✅ Both pipelines display:
  - Manufacturer Discovery Pipeline V2
  - Universal Product Intelligence Pipeline
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ No console errors

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If "No Output Directory" error persists:

1. **Double-check Root Directory setting** in Vercel project settings
2. **Try Option A**: Set Root Directory to `apps/web` and let Vercel auto-detect
3. **Verify vercel.json** is in the repository root
4. **Check build logs** to see where the `.next` directory is created

### If build fails:

1. Check that turbo is installed (it's in devDependencies)
2. Verify `turbo.json` exists and is configured
3. Check that `apps/web/package.json` has `"build": "next build"` script

### If app loads but no data:

1. **Environment variable is missing** - Add `ABACUS_API_KEY` to Vercel
2. Check browser console for API errors
3. Verify the API key is correct
