# ‚úÖ Issues Fixed & Next Steps

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Local App - API Key Configuration ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The app was showing "Failed to Load Dashboard" error.

**Solution**: The `.env` file was already configured correctly with `ABACUS_API_KEY=2802fae65af84b98883a39078c3929dd`. The app is now running successfully at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING** - Both pipelines are now visible:
- Manufacturer Discovery Pipeline V2 (fd507c760)
- Universal Product Intelligence Pipeline (1398624bb0)

---

### 2. Vercel Deployment - Build Failure ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Vercel build was failing with error:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/vercel/path0/apps/web/yarn.lock'
```

**Root Cause**: The `yarn.lock` symlink in `apps/web/` was pointing to `/opt/hostedapp/node/root/app/yarn.lock` (local system path) instead of the repository's root `yarn.lock`.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Fixed the yarn.lock symlink to point to `../../yarn.lock` (relative path)
2. Created `vercel.json` configuration file for proper monorepo build setup

**Changes Committed**:
```bash
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment: Update yarn.lock symlink and add vercel.json"
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub
Run the helper script to push the fixes:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/manufacturer_intelligence_interface
./push_changes.sh
```

Or manually push using your GitHub Personal Access Token:
```bash
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/tindevelopers/manufacturer_intelligence_interface.git master
```

---

### Step 2: Configure Vercel Environment Variables ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**

After pushing, Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment. However, you **must** add the API key to Vercel's environment variables:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Add the following variable:
   - **Key**: `ABACUS_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `2802fae65af84b98883a39078c3929dd`
   - **Environment**: Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Save and redeploy

---

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Once the build completes:
1. Visit your Vercel deployment URL
2. Verify that the dashboard loads with both pipelines
3. Test the "View Manufacturers" and "View Products" buttons

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. `apps/web/yarn.lock` - Fixed symlink to use relative path
2. `vercel.json` - Created new configuration for monorepo deployment
3. `push_changes.sh` - Helper script for pushing to GitHub

## üîç Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Local Development | ‚úÖ Working | Running on http://localhost:3000 |
| API Key Configuration | ‚úÖ Configured | `.env` file contains correct key |
| Vercel Build Config | ‚úÖ Fixed | Changes committed, ready to push |
| Vercel Environment Variables | ‚è≥ Pending | Needs manual configuration |
| GitHub Push | ‚è≥ Pending | Use `./push_changes.sh` |

---

## üìù Summary

The app is now **fully functional locally** and the Vercel deployment issues have been **fixed**. Once you push the changes to GitHub and configure the environment variables in Vercel, your app will be **live and accessible** via your Vercel URL!

**Local App Preview**: Your app is currently running at http://localhost:3000 - feel free to test all the features!

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
