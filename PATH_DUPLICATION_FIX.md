# 🔧 Path Duplication Fix

**Issue**: Routes manifest not found due to duplicate path

## 🐛 The Problem

Your build was successful, but Vercel couldn't find the output:

```
Error: The file "/vercel/path0/apps/web/apps/web/.next/routes-manifest.json" couldn't be found.
                                       ^^^^^^^^ duplicate path!
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

When you set **Root Directory = `apps/web`** in Vercel settings, Vercel starts looking from that directory.

### Configuration Mismatch:

**Vercel Settings:**
- Root Directory: `apps/web`

**vercel.json (OLD):**
```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next"
}
```

**What Vercel looked for:**
```
{Root Directory} / {outputDirectory}
= apps/web / apps/web/.next
= apps/web/apps/web/.next  ❌ WRONG!
```

---

## ✅ The Fix

**vercel.json (NEW):**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "turbo run build --filter=web",
  "outputDirectory": ".next"
}
```

**What Vercel now looks for:**
```
{Root Directory} / {outputDirectory}
= apps/web / .next
= apps/web/.next  ✓ CORRECT!
```

---

## 📝 Key Concept

When using **Root Directory** in Vercel:
- All paths in `vercel.json` are **relative to the Root Directory**
- If Root Directory = `apps/web`, then:
  - ✅ `outputDirectory: ".next"` → looks in `apps/web/.next`
  - ❌ `outputDirectory: "apps/web/.next"` → looks in `apps/web/apps/web/.next`

## 🔄 What Changed

### Git Commit: 5c5a37e

**File**: `vercel.json`

```diff
{
  "buildCommand": "turbo run build --filter=web",
- "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next"
+ "outputDirectory": ".next"
}
```

---

## 📊 Complete Configuration

### Vercel Project Settings:
```
Settings → General → Root Directory
  Value: apps/web
  Include source files outside root: ✅ Checked
```

### vercel.json:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "turbo run build --filter=web",
  "outputDirectory": ".next"
}
```

### Environment Variables (REQUIRED):
```
Settings → Environment Variables
  Name: ABACUS_API_KEY
  Value: 2802fae65af84b98883a39078c3929dd
  Environments: Production, Preview, Development
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Result

After this fix and adding the environment variable:

1. ✅ Build completes successfully
2. ✅ Output directory `.next` is found at correct path
3. ✅ Routes manifest located
4. ✅ Deployment completes
5. ✅ App loads at your Vercel URL
6. ✅ Both pipelines display correctly

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Automatic:
Vercel should automatically deploy commit `5c5a37e` from GitHub.

### Manual:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/tindeveloper/manufacturer-intelligence-interface-web
2. Click **Deployments** tab
